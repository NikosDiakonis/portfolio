      <div class="profession italic">Junior Front-End Developer | Aspiring Full Stack | Lifelong Learner</div>
      <p>My journey in web development began with <span class="span1">a 6-month eLearning course at National and
          Kapodistrian University of Athens.</span>
        During this time, I enhanced my skills in <span class="span2"> HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript,
          and explored the CSS framework Bootstrap.</span> The course also paved the way to a basic understanding
        of Python. Moreover, I was introduced to crucial web technologies like <span class="span3"> AJAX,
          jQuery, and the CMS Joomla. </span>Alongside these studies, I took the initiative to learn
        Git and GitHub independently while working on various projects.
      </p>
      <p>Currently, I am channeling my energy into building projects to solidify and broaden my expertise. These
        personal projects are not just a testament to my dedication but also a playground for experimenting with new
        ideas and technologies.</p>
      <p>Parallel to this hands-on approach, I have charted a roadmap for my professional growth. This plan includes
        delving into <span class="span4"> WordPress and WooCommerce as also expanding my backend knowledge,
          focusing on learning SQL, PostgreSQL and React.js. </span></p>
